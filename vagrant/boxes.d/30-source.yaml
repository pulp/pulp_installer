# Update the Travis scripts whenever you update the RAM/CPU values
#
# The design of pulp2-nightly-pulp3-source-fips-a & pulp2-nightly-pulp3-source-fips-b is as follows:
# 1. pulp2-nightly-pulp3-source-fips-a is a VM that runs pulp 3 in FIPS mode,
#    and potentially SELinux in the future.
# 2. pulp2-nightly-pulp3-source-fips-b is a container that runs pulp 2 in FIPS mode.
# 3. a runs docker, and b uses the vagrant docker provider, which can use a VM
#    as the docker host (force_host_vm). It is uncommon to use a functional box
#    as the docker host (normally boot2docker), but supported.
# 4. We want to make sure the container never tries to do NFS to the host,
#    as we assume the host doesn't run it. (Although even then the container
#    networking might be an issue.)
# 5. Because of #4 and for performance, we pre-build the image. We do not want
#    to make the host build the image (host_vm_build_dir_options), because it
#    would invoke NFS.
# 6. Users must run separate commands to up a, then b, the 1st time.
#    This is because we add user "vagrant" user to the "docker" group
#    during ansible provisioning of a, and Vagrant would otherwise maintain
#    a persistent SSH connection from the beginning of up'ing a, that never gets
#    reset/newgrp'd to recognize the new group membership, even after it starts
#    up'ing b.
