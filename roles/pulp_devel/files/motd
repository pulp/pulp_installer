Welcome to the Pulp dev environment!

Here are some tips:

* Your code is all checked out inside of ``~/devel/``.
* Several bash aliases have been installed. ``phelp`` will list them and what
  they do.

More information can be found at the `contributing guide`_ and you can ask
questions in #pulp on Freenode IRC. Happy hacking, and thanks for your
contribution!
