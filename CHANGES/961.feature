The Pulp services now accept environment variable overrides via /etc/default/pulpcore (all services, lowest priority), /etc/default/pulpcore-api, /etc/default/pulpcore-content, /etc/default/pulpcore-worker and /etc/default/pulpcore-worker-%i (the number of the worker service instance, highest priority.) /etc/default/pulp-workers and /etc/default/pulp-workers-%i no longer function.
