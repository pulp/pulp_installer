Fix the database fields key being generated as non-identical across multiple hosts, which in turn broke multiple runtime actions (for clustered setups with multiple hosts) such as syncing remotes for galaxy_ng. Also install the key on worker hosts. Introduces the advanced variable `pulp_database_config_host` to set which host will have its key copied to all the others (otherwise, random.)
